Objective:
- Build a web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors and genres released during the 1980s. Users are able to register, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies Iâ€™ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

Key Features: 
- Return a list of movies of the 80's to the user.
- Return data about a single movie by title to the user.
- Return data about movie genres to the user.
- Return data about directors and actors to the user.
- Allow new users to register.
- Allow users to update their data by username.
- Allow existing users to deregister by username.
- Allow users to add and remove movies to their "Favorites" list by movie ID.
- Allow users to add and remove movies to their "To Watch" list by movie ID.
- Secure access to the API data: authentication and authorization with HTTP and JSON Web Token.
