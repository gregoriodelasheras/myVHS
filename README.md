Objective:
- Build a web application provides users with access to information about different movies, directors and genres released during the 1980s. Users are able to register, update their personal information and create a list of their favorite movies.

User Stories:
- As a user, I want to be able to receive information on movies, directors, and genres so that I can learn more about movies I’ve watched or am interested in.
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite movies.

Key Features: 
- Return a list of all the movies of the 80's to the user.
- Return data (description, genre, director, image URL, whether it’s featured or not) about a single movie by title to the user.
- Return data about a genre (description) by name/title (e.g., “Thriller”).
- Return data about a director (bio, birth year, death year) by name.
- Allow new users to register.
- Allow users to update their user info (username, password, email, date of birth).
- Allow users to add a movie to their list of favorites.
- Allow users to remove a movie from their list of favorites.
- Allow existing users to deregister.
- Allow users to see which actors star in which movies.
- Allow users to view information about different actors.
- Allow users to view more information about different movies, such as the release date and the movie rating.
- Allow users to create a “To Watch” list in addition to their “Favorite Movies” list.
