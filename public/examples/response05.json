  "description": "The adventure genre is so similar to the action genre that adventure films are often categorized as action/adventure movies. Films in the adventure genre usually contain the same basic genre elements of an action movie with the setting as the key difference. Adventure movies are usually set in an exotic, far away, or unfamiliar locale."
